Code is in the `src` directory, `dependencies.jar` contains `gson` and `JUnit`. 

Run `compile.sh` to compile the code, then run `run.sh` to run the test.

If you have trouble compiling the code, try to run `run_precompiled.sh` or `run_precompiled.bat`, which will use the precompiled jar to run the test.
